# [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#readme) - test summary

# All validators fail this test

`some languages do not distinguish between different types of numeric value, a float is not an integer even without fractional part`

# [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#readme) failed tests

Some validators have deliberately chosen not to support parts of the spec. Go to the [`jsonschema`](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#readme) homepage to learn if
that is the case for these tests.
